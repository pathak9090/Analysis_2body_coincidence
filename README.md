### General info
This project analyses and calculates the momentum and energies based on positions and time-of-flight for individual particles hitting the position sensitive detector. The input data file is a large binary file with positions and time for several hundread million particles. This analysis works for two-particle and three-particle coincidence, it can also be easily extended to multi-body coincidences.
